CNN Image Classification
Overview
The "CNN Image Classification" project aims to classify images as either happy or sad. It utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled happy and sad images and is then used to predict unseen images' emotions.

Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Rhythm1821/CNN-Image-Classification.git
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy requests matplotlib pillow
Usage
To run the image classification script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, execute the image_classification.py script available in the cloned repository.

Implementation Details
The project was implemented using Google Colab. The steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

Downloaded the happy and sad images from Google and stored them separately.
Zipped the image folders and hosted them on a GitHub repository.
In the Colab environment, the data was unzipped and organized.
The dataset was labeled using TensorFlow.
Images with a size less than 10KB were removed to improve data quality.
A deep CNN model was constructed, utilizing TensorFlow and Keras.
The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the metric.
After training, loss and accuracy metrics were calculated.
Unseen happy and sad images were used to make predictions using the trained model.
The model was saved for future use.
Future Plans
In the future, there are plans to build a website for the project. The website will serve as a platform to demonstrate the image classification model, provide a user-friendly interface to upload images for classification, and share insights into the project's development process.
